       "      <td>O'Sullivan clinched the first two frames of the second session to reduce his deficit to 4ï¿½6, before Trump won two of the next three frames to lead 8ï¿½5. O'Sullivan won both frames 14 and 15 with two century breaks of 130 and 134 to trail 7ï¿½8, and won a tense frame 16 to tie the match.[15] Trump won a scrappy frame 17 to lead again, before O'Sullivan won frame 18 to send the match into the final frame.[16] In the decider, Trump secured the first chance, but his break ended at 50 points. Despite a waistcoat foul on his previous shot, O'Sullivan was given another opportunity to clear the table, but he missed the final red near the cushion rail, allowing his opponent back on the table.[17] Trump missed the match-winning yellow close to the cushion into the green pocket,[15] which eventually allowed O'Sullivan to clear the table to complete the comeback on the final black ball.[16][18]</td>\n",

       "87  In the second round, which took place on 21 and 22 March, the four remaining players competed in two best-of-19-frames matches, each played over two sessions. The first semi-final was played on 21 March, between Judd Trump and Ronnie O'Sullivan. The pair were the highest two in the ranking list for the Coral Cup, both having won one of the previous two events in the Coral series: Trump winning the World Grand Prix, and O'Sullivan the Players Championship.[12] This semi-final was a rematch of the season's Masters final, and the two players also met in the final of the 2018 Northern Ireland Open, Trump winning on both occasions.[14]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "88  Trump took the first frame in the opening session of the match with a break of 54, before O'Sullivan tied the score at one frame apiece.[15] Trump won frames three and four to lead 3ï¿½1 at the interval.[15] He also won frame five, before O'Sullivan made a century to trail by two frames. Trump took the remaining two frames of the session to lead 6ï¿½2.[14]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "89  O'Sullivan clinched the first two frames of the second session to reduce his deficit to 4ï¿½6, before Trump won two of the next three frames to lead 8ï¿½5. O'Sullivan won both frames 14 and 15 with two century breaks of 130 and 134 to trail 7ï¿½8, and won a tense frame 16 to tie the match.[15] Trump won a scrappy frame 17 to lead again, before O'Sullivan won frame 18 to send the match into the final frame.[16] In the decider, Trump secured the first chance, but his break ended at 50 points. Despite a waistcoat foul on his previous shot, O'Sullivan was given another opportunity to clear the table, but he missed the final red near the cushion rail, allowing his opponent back on the table.[17] Trump missed the match-winning yellow close to the cushion into the green pocket,[15] which eventually allowed O'Sullivan to clear the table to complete the comeback on the final black ball.[16][18]  "
